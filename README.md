<h1>Security Groups and Permissions</h1>
File sharing in a computer is essentially a process to send something out from your computer to another in joint access. Such example is that a folder that not only you access, but the overall network or directory can access based on permissions and groups. Using file shares are more efficient than sending constant emails back and forth of new file updates, or having access to certain files. File shares from Google Drive, Google Docs, Microsoft Excel are other programs other than just Windows.

<h2>Purpose of File Sharing </h2>

Rather than sending out new programs or file updates or new documents constantly through email, file sharing can be used by an Admin to grant permissions to a wide range of users to limit the time used by the admin and it is also an easier way to keep everything organized and up to date. This is a big advantage for workers that are Remote, as it is more simplified for them to click on a shared folder where they have "Read permissions" for files. I.T teams can benefit from file sharing to limit the amount of storage used for certain files and programs, and to collectively access up to date programs. Companies can increase productivity and workflow without having to worry if each worker are having access to certain files and having to worry about running out of storage, or constantly looking for cluttered information. 


<h2>Groups and Permissions</h2>

Following a Windows example, file sharing access is determined by the type of group and type of permission that is allowed for any person.
Examples of Groups
- User
- Admins
- "x" Name (any name group the admin can make)
Assigning groups to people can determine what kind of permissions they can have while accessing a file.
Types of Permissions
- Read Access
- Write Access
- No Access

Multiple permissions can be selected based on what the company or person wants to grant to the group. Usually in a company if you distribute new program files, or training documents, information that is for the higher ups to edit, you would assign "Read Only" to users and "Read and Write" to Admins. Information that should NOT be viewed by a normal user should have the permissions of "No Access" in that case they will not be able to have access to view that folder.
